## Skills

#### Analysis

Whilst studying as an undergraduate in Law, I frequently practised my analytical skills when using judgements from a case as evidence for arguments in my essays. I learned in-depth analytical skills which I then practiced in a commercial environment on my various work-placements.  

#### Teamwork

I have experience working both within and as a leader of a team. From these experiences I have developed concrete interpersonal and communication skills which I will carry through my career as a software developer.

At University I volunteered at the Schools Outreach Project. The aim of the project is to give pupils from under-privileged backgrounds the experience and skills required so that they can pursue a career in law. In my final year I was appointed Head of Logistics which involved organising the preparation for our events.

During all 3 engineering projects at Makers Academy I was the strict enforcer of our snack rotation. Well-fed developers are happy developers. Happy developers are productive.

#### Dedication

Whether at an intensive Spanish course or a programming bootcamp I have remained committed to continuously challenging myself and persevere with any task I am set.

#### Fast Learner

Makers bootcamp teaches you to never feel satisfied with your level of knowledge. Once you've conquered your understanding of one concept, you are merely a step closer to your next goal. I've felt myself subconsciously adopting this mentality and now have an insatiable curiosity to learn and find answers.

During final projects at Makers Academy we had 10 days to develop a product of our choice, which we would then present to an audience of about 100 people. My team decided to stretch ourselves further by creating our app in Swift, a language none of us had any experience in. We created an awesome app that simulates a deck of cards.
